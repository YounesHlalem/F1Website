                    Finishes runner-up to Mercedes team mate Hamilton for the second year in succession, though this
                    time the fight is not as close, despite six wins and seven poles. A late-season surge in form,
                    however, hints at a closer contest in prospect for 2016.
                    <br/><br/> <span>2014</span><br/><br/>
                    Dominates Mercedes team mate Hamilton in qualifying, securing 11 poles in the all-conquering F1 W05.
                    With five wins and 10 further podiums, takes title race down to the wire, but ultimately cannot
                    quite match his rival's race form, finishing a strong second overall.
                    <br/><br/> <span>2013</span><br/><br/>
                    Misses out on early podium in Malaysia because of team orders, but then takes three consecutive
                    poles and is rewarded with well-deserved Monaco victory for Mercedes. Wins again in Great Britain en
                    route to sixth overall in the standings.
                    <br/><br/> <span>2012</span><br/><br/>
                    The breakthrough finally comes as he scores first his maiden Formula One pole and then his first F1
                    victory at round three in China. Mercedes then suffer a big dip in performance and he struggles to
                    finish in the points regularly. Finishes the season ninth overall.
                    <br/><br/> <span>2011</span><br/><br/>
                    Extends reputation as one of Formula One's most complete driver packages, beating team mate
                    Schumacher to seventh overall, but top results hard to come by due to lack of pace from Mercedes'
                    MGP W02.
                    <br/><br/> <span>2010</span><br/><br/>
                    Despite Mercedes MGP W01's difficulties, puts it on podium on several occasions as he impresses in
                    domination of new team mate and returning seven-time champion, Michael Schumacher. Scores almost
                    twice his compatriot's points total to finish seventh overall.
                    <br/><br/> <span>2009</span><br/><br/>
                    Continues to extract the most from his machinery, making Q3 at almost every round and edging closer
                    to the podium as the year progresses. Fourth places in Germany and Hungary his best results.
                    Announces Williams departure and signs for new Mercedes team for 2010.
                    <br/><br/> <span>2008</span><br/><br/>
                    Starts season with first F1 podium in Australia and goes even better with a second place in
                    Singapore later in the year. In between times, however, hampered by FW30's poor race pace. Three
                    eighth places his only other scoring results, leaving him 13th overall.
                    <br/><br/><span>2007</span><br/><br/>
                    Proves more mature - and even quicker - in second season with Williams. Stunning qualifying pace
                    secures ten top-ten grid slots. Scores career-best fourth place at final round in Brazil to finish
                    ninth overall on 20 points.
                    <br/><br/><span>2006</span><br/><br/>
                    Difficult debut season with Williams. Clocks fastest lap in Bahrain season opener and qualifies
                    third in Malaysia before combination of accidents and poor reliability weakens his campaign.
                    Finishes 14th overall, three places behind team mate Mark Webber.
                    <br/><br/> <span>2005</span><br/><br/>
                    Wins the inaugural GP2 championship, the replacement series for Formula 3000. Signed as Williams
                    test driver in May, before winning race contract with the team for 2006.
                    <br/><br/><span>2004</span><br/><br/>
                    Takes a further three victories in the Formula Three Euro Series.
                    <br/><br/><span>2003</span><br/><br/>
                    Graduates to Formula Three Euro Series with Team Rosberg. Claims one race win and finishes eighth
                    overall in the championship.
                    <br/><br/><span>2002</span><br/><br/>
                    Spectacular single-seater debut, winning Formula ADAC Championship with nine victories. It earns him
                    a Williams test and at 17 he becomes the youngest person to drive a Formula One car.</p>
