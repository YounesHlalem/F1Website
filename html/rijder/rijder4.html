                <h2>Carriere:</h2>
                <p>
                    <span>2015</span><br/><br/>
                    Revives his reputation with a stellar first season for Ferrari, in which he is the only non-Mercedes
                    driver to win a Grand Prix, taking victory three times and finishing on the podium a further 10,
                    leaving team mate Kimi Raikkonen in his wake.
                    <br/><br/><span>2014</span><br/><br/>
                    Struggles to match team mate Ricciardo as Red Bull fall off pace with 2014's dramatic technical rule
                    changes. Announces in October that he will leave team at end of year, moving to Ferrari. Second in
                    Singapore his best result. Slips to fifth in final standings.
                    <br/><br/><span>2013</span><br/><br/>
                    Courts controversy early on by ignoring team orders and passing team mate Webber to win in Malaysia.
                    A further 12 victories - including the last nine rounds - matches Schumacher's record of 13 wins in
                    a season and ease him to a fourth consecutive title.
                    <br/><br/><span>2012</span><br/><br/>
                    Slow to adjust to the blown diffuser-less RB8 and has to wait until the fourth round in Bahrain to
                    score his first pole position and race victory of the season. A late-campaign surge including four
                    consecutive wins helps lift him to a third successive drivers' title.
                    <br/><br/><span>2011</span><br/><br/>
                    Totally dominates for Red Bull, becoming youngest double world champion in F1 history with four
                    rounds to spare. Scores 11 wins and a record 15 pole positions.
                    <br/><br/><span>2010</span><br/><br/>
                    Despite some driver errors and technical maladies - plus tense rivalry with team mate Webber -
                    supreme pace brings 10 poles and five victories en route to becoming youngest champion in F1
                    history. Comes from third in standings to clinch title with win at final round in Abu Dhabi.
                    <br/><br/><span>2009</span><br/><br/>
                    Continues to make the headlines for all the right reasons. Scores Red Bull's maiden pole and win in
                    China, before winning again at Silverstone and Suzuka. A final victory at the season-ending Abu
                    Dhabi Grand Prix helps him clinch second in the drivers' championship.
                    <br/><br/><span>2008</span><br/><br/>
                    First full season of Formula One sees him become the sport's youngest winner with a stunning
                    wet-weather victory at Monza. Finishes eighth overall with 35 points and rewarded with a switch from
                    Toro Rosso to Red Bull's 'senior' RBR team for 2009.
                    <br/><br/><span>2007</span><br/><br/>
                    Becomes sport's youngest point scorer when he stands in for BMW's Robert Kubica at Indy, finishing
                    eighth. Secures full-time Toro Rosso race seat from August's Hungarian Grand Prix and earns the team
                    their best result to date with fourth place in China.
                    <br/><br/><span>2006</span><br/><br/>
                    Runner-up in Formula Three Euro Series after three race wins. Competes in three World Series by
                    Renault events, winning two. Named BMW Sauber's Friday test and reserve driver - five successful
                    third-driver outings.
                    <br/><br/><span>2005</span><br/><br/>
                    Fifth in the Formula 3 Euro Series, declared best rookie driver after clinching five podiums. Enjoys
                    first Formula One test with BMW Williams at Jerez.
                    <br/><br/><span>2004</span><br/><br/>
                    Formula BMW ADAC champion - finishes on podium in all 20 races, taking 18 victories.
                    <br/><br/><span>2003</span><br/><br/>
                    Claims second place in the Formula BMW ADAC championship after winning five of the 19 races.
                    <br/><br/><span>2002</span><br/><br/>
                    Wins German and European Junior karting titles.
