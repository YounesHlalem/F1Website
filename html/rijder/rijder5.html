                <h2>Carriere:</h2>
                <p>
                    <span>2015</span><br/><br/>
                    Ferrari's form improves, but Raikkonen's relative to his team mate - now Sebastian Vettel - doesn't.
                    Secures just three podiums to the German's 13, and zero wins to his colleague's three. Finishes
                    fourth in the driver standings.
                    <br/><br/><span>2014</span><br/><br/>
                    First season back at Ferrari proves highly disappointing as he struggles to gel with the
                    less-than-competitive F14 T. Fails to make the podium, with fourth in Belgium his best result.
                    Finishes 12th overall, six places and 106 points behind team mate Alonso.
                    <br/><br/><span>2013</span><br/><br/>
                    Emerges as early title contender after brilliant win in Australia and three consecutive second
                    places in China, Bahrain and Spain, before Lotus form takes slight dip. Signs for Ferrari for 2014
                    in September and misses last two rounds of season for back surgery.
                    <br/><br/><span>2012</span><br/><br/>
                    Five podiums - including three second-place finishes - from opening 11 races is a great start to the
                    Finn's comeback season, but a win remains elusive until the 18th round in Abu Dhabi. Victory
                    combined with brilliant consistency helps solidify a strong third place in the standings.
                    <br/><br/><span>2011</span><br/><br/>
                    Competes for a second season in the World Rally Championship. Struggles to make much of an
                    impression and signs to make his Formula One comeback with Lotus in 2012.
                    <br/><br/><span>2010</span><br/><br/>
                    Leaves Formula One racing to pursue a career in rallying. Competes in 11 rounds of the World Rally
                    Championship. Best finish is fifth in Turkey.
                    <br/><br/><span>2009</span><br/><br/>
                    Lacklustre early form prompts talk of lack of interest, but breaks back onto podium with third in
                    Monaco, second in Hungary and Ferrari's only 2009 win in Belgium. Drops off pace in latter races as
                    team halt F60 development. Loses drive to Alonso for 2010.
                    <br/><br/><span>2008</span><br/><br/>
                    Strong start to season before championship-winning form of 2007 deserts him, particularly in
                    qualifying. Ends year playing supporting role to team mate Felipe Massa, despite a record-equalling
                    10 fastest laps. Re-signs for a further two seasons with Ferrari.
                    <br/><br/><span>2007</span><br/><br/>
                    Wins on his very first appearance for Ferrari in Australia and goes on to take a further five
                    victories, including a vital win at the final round in Brazil, which sees him come from behind to
                    take his first drivers' title by a single point.
                    <br/><br/><span>2006</span><br/><br/>
                    Fails to win a race in final season for McLaren, whose car is unable to match the performance of
                    Renault's and Ferrari's. Nevertheless scores in every round he finishes to take fifth in the
                    standings. Signs new deal with Ferrari for 2007.
                    <br/><br/><span>2005</span><br/><br/>
                    Five poles, seven wins, five podiums, but only second in the championship due to reliability issues.
                    Greatest victory arguably at Suzuka, where he starts 17th on the grid and passes Renault's Giancarlo
                    Fisichella on the final lap to win.
                    <br/><br/><span>2004</span><br/><br/>
                    Early-season reliability problems put an early end to championship hopes, but he proves his
                    resilience with pole position at Silverstone and a superb victory over Ferrari's Michael Schumacher
                    in the Belgian Grand Prix.
                    <br/><br/><span>2003</span><br/><br/>
                    Takes maiden Grand Prix win in Malaysia and a total of ten podium finishes. Emerges as Michael
                    Schumacher's most consistent title challenger. Runner-up in the drivers' championship, just two
                    points behind the German.
                    <br/><br/><span>2002</span><br/><br/>
                    Joins McLaren and takes three third places and a second in his first season with the team.
                    <br/><br/><span>2001</span><br/><br/>
                    A strong debut season for Sauber. He takes nine points to finish 10th in the drivers' championship
                    and manages ten top-ten qualifying performances.
