                <h2>Carriere:</h2>
                <p>
                    <span>2015</span><br/><br/>
                    Intense rivalry with Mercedes team mate Nico Rosberg continues, but again Hamilton prevails, winning
                    10 times to become only the 10th driver to become a triple world champion and the first Briton to
                    claim back-to-back titles.
                    <br/><br/><span>2014</span><br/><br/>
                    Makes the most of Mercedes F1 W05 Hybrid's dominance, taking 11 wins en route to his second world
                    title, though he is pushed all the way by team mate Rosberg, with the championship only decided
                    between the two at the season's final round.
                    <br/><br/><span>2013</span><br/><br/>
                    Enjoys relatively seamless transition from McLaren to Mercedes, despite difficulties adapting to F1
                    W04's braking system. Scores one victory, four podiums and five poles en route to fourth in the
                    championship, two places above team mate Nico Rosberg.
                    <br/><br/><span>2012</span><br/><br/>
                    The MP4-27 may have been competitive, but poor luck means the Briton has to wait until Canada to
                    score his first win of the season. He follows it up with victories in Hungary, Italy and the USA but
                    mechanical gremlins blunt his title charge. Signs to Mercedes for 2013.
                    <br/><br/><span>2011</span><br/><br/>
                    Beaten by a team mate for the first time in final standings after a frustrating season in the grid's
                    second fastest car. Three victories countered by several stewards visits and penalties, often after
                    clashes with Ferrari's Felipe Massa. Finishes fifth overall.
                    <br/><br/><span>2010</span><br/><br/>
                    Storming drives stymied by dubious strategy calls in early races, but successive wins in Turkey and
                    Canada stake claim for second drivers' crown. Loses lead in Italy, as MP4-25 increasingly outpaced
                    by Red Bull and Ferrari. Wins at Spa, en route to fourth overall.
                    <br/><br/><span>2009</span><br/><br/>
                    Disqualified from fourth in Australia for misleading race stewards. Averages a point a race until
                    round ten, when he scores shock win after car development comes good. Four poles and four further
                    podiums, including a win in Singapore, round off season in resurgent fashion.
                    <br/><br/><span>2008</span><br/><br/>
                    At 23, becomes the youngest world champion in Formula One history, after five wins and a further
                    five podiums take him to the title by a single point on only his second attempt. Commits to McLaren
                    until the end of 2012.
                    <br/><br/><span>2007</span><br/><br/>
                    Stunning debut season, scoring podiums in his first nine races. Secures four wins and six poles as
                    he out-performs champion team mate Fernando Alonso. Title favourite until errors in final two rounds
                    drop him to second place behind Kimi Raikkonen.
                    <br/><br/><span>2006</span><br/><br/>
                    Wins the GP2 championship at his first attempt, earning himself his maiden Formula One test and a
                    McLaren race drive for 2007.
                    <br/><br/><span>2005</span><br/><br/>
                    Dominates the Formula Three Euroseries, taking the title with 15 wins, 10 fastest laps and 13 pole
                    positions.
                    <br/><br/><span>2004</span><br/><br/>
                    Graduates to the Formula Three Euroseries. Finishes fifth overall, with one victory and a further
                    two podiums.
                    <br/><br/><span>2003</span><br/><br/>
                    Wins Formula Renault title with two rounds to spare. Ten race victories, nine fastest laps and 11
                    pole positions.
                    <br/><br/><span>2002</span><br/><br/>
                    Graduates from karting to single-seaters, finishing third in the Formula Renault series.</p>
