            <img src="https://www.formula1.com/content/fom-website/en/latest/headlines/2016/11/f1-pirelli-reveals-brazilian-gp-tyre-selections/_jcr_content/image16x9.img.1024.medium.jpg/1478086938388.jpg"/>
            <p>Championship contenders Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg have once again opted for the exact same strategy
                for the weekend, with both drivers choosing one set of hards, four sets of mediums and eight sets of
                softs.
                <br/><br/>
                Red Bull and Ferrari have opted for different selections however. Red Bull will take one fewer set of
                softs and one additional set of mediums to Interlagos, while Ferrari's drivers are split - Sebastian
                Vettel has opted for the same allocation as Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen, but Kimi Raikkonen has
                added an extra set of hards, and one less set of mediums.
                <br/><br/>
                Only three other drivers have also opted for two sets of hards - Force India's Nico Hulkenberg and
                Sergio Perez, and Haas's Esteban Gutierrez.
                <br/><br/>
                Williams meanwhile have been amongst the most aggressive - in what will be his farewell Grand Prix in
                Brazil, Felipe Massa will have nine sets of softs to use over the three days.</p>

            <h2>No FIA disciplinary action over Vettel outbursts</h2>
            <p class="datum">01 Nov 2016</p>
            <img src="https://www.formula1.com/content/fom-website/en/latest/headlines/2016/11/fia-will-not-take-disciplinary-action-over-vettel-outbursts/_jcr_content/image16x9.img.1024.medium.jpg/1478026654737.jpg"/>
            <p>Vettel directed pointed remarks towards FIA race director Charlie Whiting and Red Bull driver Max
                Verstappen in the closing stages of the Grand Prix following a tense battle with the Dutchman.
                <br/><br/>
                However, in a statement issued on Tuesday the FIA said that Vettel had "spontaneously sought out Charlie
                Whiting to express his regrets for his behaviour in person."
                <br/><br/>
                "He then, again on his own initiative, sent letters to each of the FIA President Jean Todt and Charlie
                Whiting, in which he apologised profusely for his actions," the statement continued. "He also indicated
                that he would likewise be contacting Max Verstappen and vowed that such an incident would never occur
                again.
                <br/><br/>
                "In the light of this sincere apology and strong commitment, the FIA President has decided, on an
                exceptional basis, not to take disciplinary action against Mr Vettel by bringing this matter before the
                FIA International Tribunal.
                <br/><br/>
                "The FIA will always condemn the use of offensive language in motor sport – especially when directed at
                officials and/or fellow participants – and expects all participants in its Championships to be
                respectful and mindful of the example they set for the public and the younger generation in particular.
                <br/><br/>
                "The FIA takes this opportunity to advise that, in the event of any future incident similar to the one
                that occurred in Mexico, disciplinary action will be taken by bringing such incident before the FIA
                International Tribunal to be judged."</p>

            <h2>Ricciardo inherits third after Vettel penalised for erratic driving</h2>
            <p class="datum">31 Oct 2016</p>
            <img src="https://www.formula1.com/content/fom-website/en/latest/headlines/2016/10/ricciardo-inherits-third-after-vettel-penalised-for-erratic-driv/_jcr_content/image16x9.img.2048.medium.jpg"/>
            <p>Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel has been given a ten-second time penalty for driving ‘dangerously or
                erratically’ while defending fourth place from Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo in the closing stages of
                Sunday’s Formula 1 Gran Premio de Mexico 2016.
                <br/><br/>
                It means Vettel drops from third to fifth in the final classification, with Ricciardo moving up to third
                and Red Bull team mate Max Verstappen - who earlier had five seconds added to his race time for going
                off track and gaining an advantage whilst battling the four-time champion - to fourth.
                <br/><br/>
                In making their decision, the stewards referred to the race director Charlie Whiting’s recent directive
                in the United States, which stipulated that any change of direction under braking which results in
                another driver having to take evasive action will be considered abnormal and hence potentially dangerous
                to other drivers.
                <br/><br/>
                According to the stewards report telemetry and video evidence showed that Vettel did change direction
                under braking for Turn 4 and that “this was considered to be potentially dangerous in view of the
                proximity of the wheels of each car.”
                <br/><br/>
                In addition to a 10-second penalty, Vettel was also handed two penalty points on his license, bringing
                his total to six points in the last 12 months.
                <br/><br/>
                Ferrari boss Maurizio Arrivabene said 'bureaucracy' had robbed his team of a podium, adding that the
                decision was "too harsh and somehow unfair."</p>
        </section>
        <section class="news" id="news4">
            <h2>Ricciardo: Vettel didn't deserve podium</h2>
            <p class="datum">30 Oct 2016</p>
            <img src="https://www.formula1.com/content/fom-website/en/latest/headlines/2016/10/ricciardo--vettel-didn-t-deserve-podium/_jcr_content/image16x9.img.2048.medium.jpg"/>
            <p>Ricciardo had been closing on Vettel as he duelled for third with the second Red Bull of Max Verstappen.
                With Vettel bottled up behind the Dutchman, Ricciardo pounced at Turn 4 and appeared to have the inside
                line - only for Vettel to squeeze the Australian, with the pair making light contact several times
                before Vettel eventually fended Ricciardo off to hold position.
                <br/><br/>
                For me he doesn't deserve to be up there [on the podium] with the move he pulled.
                Daniel Ricciardo
                "I just felt that Seb did what everyone's been complaining about lately, moving under braking,"
                Ricciardo said of the incident, which stewards are investigating. "He is smiling now. For me he doesn't
                deserve to be up there [on the podium] with the move he pulled.
                <br/><br/>
                "It looked like he opened the door, I committed and had every right to be there, but he kept closing the
                door and in the end I had nowhere to go.
                <br/><br/>
                "I was frustrated by that. We know Max's moves have been a bit questionable - that was the same case
                today with Seb. Don't get me wrong I love racing, I love racing hard and even a bit of contact, but this
                whole moving under braking - you don't move after you've been out-foxed.
                <br/><br/>
                "Seb moved early, I'd won the chess match you could say, and then he went 'oh no' and moved late and
                left me nowhere to go. To me that’s not right. It was still a fun race, but I would have loved to be up
                there on the podium."
                <br/><br/>
                Red Bull motorsport consultant Helmut Marko echoed his driver's sentiments, telling Formula1.com: "I
                thought there is a new rule about not moving under braking - and I have never seen a more clear
                misconduct of a rule then what Sebastian Vettel has done in this race when moving very aggressively
                towards Daniel Ricciardo’s car."
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Ricciardo also questioned the fact that winner Lewis Hamilton had escaped without penalty after the
                Mercedes star locked up heavily and went off over the Turn 1 run-off at the start of the race.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                "I also didn’t understand the start, how you can be leading, lock the brakes, go off and come out in
                front," Ricciardo said.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                "I think he deserved the penalty; I think anyone who does that deserves a penalty.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                "If you lock up and miss the corner you have to pay the price - Max too. I don't know, I'm just a bit
                frustrated with how it panned out. I really wanted to be on the podium..."</p>

            <p>For a while it seemed that the Red Bull duo would separate the Mercedes on the grid for the Formula 1
                Gran Premio de Mexico 2016, as championship leader Nico Rosberg was fourth, well behind team mate Lewis
                Hamilton who was firmly on pole. But on his final run Rosberg managed to vault past Max Verstappen and
                Daniel Ricciardo to claim the other front-row grid slot. By comparison, Ferrari were nowhere.
                <br/><br/>
                Force India’s Nico Hulkenberg starred as he beat the scarlet cars of Kimi Raikkonen and Sebastian Vettel
                to secure fifth. The Williams of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa, and Toro Rosso’s Carlos Sainz
                completed the top ten.
                <br/><br/>
                Conditions were the best they’d been so far this weekend at the start of Q1, with 50 degrees Celsius
                track temperature at the start, and 17 degrees ambient.
                <br/><br/>
                Of the frontrunners, Hamilton set the early pace with 1m 19.770s, but that was then beaten by Vettel
                with 1m 19.865s, Verstappen with 1m 19.874s and Raikkonen with 1m 19.554s, and then Ricciardo did 1m
                19.713s. At one stage Mercedes were only fifth and sixth after Rosberg had improved to 1m 19.996s. But
                then Hamilton got a good, clean run to go fastest by 0.107s on 1m 19.447s.
                <br/><br/>
                Further back, Manor’s Pascal Wehrlein bounced local hero Esteban Gutierrez with 1m 21.363s right at the
                end, just after the Mexican had spun his Haas in Turn 9 trying to improve on 1m 21.401s. Toro Rosso’s
                Daniil Kvyat was left 18th on 1m 21.454s after complaining of power loss, and Felipe Nasr was unable to
                repeat his Sauber team mate’s 13th fastest time and was 19th after trailing him by six-tenths. Esteban
                Ocon in the second Manor was 20th on 1m 21.881s, as a troubled Romain Grosjean couldn’t better 1m
                21.916s for 21st after having to avoid his spinning team mate at the end.
                <br/><br/>
                Missing altogether from the session was Jolyon Palmer, who had been 14th in FP3. After that session a
                crack was found in the monocoque of his Renault, necessitating a rebuild around the spare tub. As a
                result, he will start Sunday’s race at the stewards’ discretion from the back of the grid.</p>
